Android eclair rootfs scripts
--------------------------------------

These scripts are meant to be used by packagers who are creating a new rootfs
image from a local checkout of the git repo.

gitclean.sh
===========
This script will clean out all git-related files from the rootfs. This is not
inherently necessary, but is needed to keep the rootfs small. Run this file
from the root directory of the image.

 * Invocation: $ scripts/gitclean.sh

distprepare.py
==============
This is a python script written with py2.6 in mind. This script will read a
map of file and directory permissions from scripts/perms.map. This map will
have been created from previous releases of the rootfs image. The script will
adjust all permissions to exactly those listed in the file (it will need root
access for this).

The script must be run from the root directory of the image. The perms.map file
must reside in the scripts directory.

 * Invocation: $ sudo scripts/distprepare.py

generate-rootfs.sh
==================
This is a quick-and-dirty shell script to generate a rootfs.img from a given
git repository and, optionally, a given branch. This will do everything from
check out the repository to build the loopback filesystem itself.

This script uses the following packager scripts also located in the scripts
directory: gitclean.sh, distprepare.py

This script does a few things that require root access, including setting up
permissions and mounting a loopback device. As such, it requires a local sudo
installation (and consequently, proper configuration).

There are a few shell variables used in the script as configuration. They are
located at the beginning of the script before any commands. Adjust them as you
see fit, then invoke the script.

This script is not designed to be run in any particular directory. You may run
it even in a live development repository (though this is not suggested). It
will do all work on a temporary git clone, which it then deletes.

 * Invocation: $ ./generate-rootfs.sh
