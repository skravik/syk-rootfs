Android eclair rootfs scripts
--------------------------------------

These scripts are meant to be used by packagers who are creating a new rootfs
image from a local checkout of the git repo.

gitclean.sh
===========
This script will clean out all git-related files from the rootfs. This is not
inherently necessary, but is needed to keep the rootfs small. Run this file
from the root directory of the image.

 * Invocation: $ scripts/gitclean.sh

distprepare.py
==============
This is a python script written with py2.6 in mind. This script will read a
map of file and directory permissions from scripts/perms.map. This map will
have been created from previous releases of the rootfs image. The script will
adjust all permissions to exactly those listed in the file (it will need root
access for this).

The script must be run from the root directory of the image. The perms.map file
must reside in the scripts directory.

 * Invocation: $ sudo scripts/distprepare.py
